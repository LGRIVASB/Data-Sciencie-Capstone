<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The next project is a word prediction Shiny app. The app is the final project of the Data Science Capstone Course in Coursera.
The objective is an application that predicts words using a natural language.
We will need to input a text and the application will looked it up in the training corpus data and the most common word in its list of following words will be suggested similar to 
the technology of Swiftkey implemented on the smart phones.</p> 

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p> The app has 2 section. The first one is the <strong>instruction and review criteria for the final project submission</strong> tab. 
The second one is the <strong>word prediction model visualization</strong> there you can input a word or a simple phrase and you will receive the possible next word to complete the phrase.</p>

<h3>Instruction and review criteria</h3>
<p>This section is going to show you the instruction and the review criteria about the final project submission. You can use it as a guide to evaluate my app.</p>
<p>The submission consist in three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Repository project files where you can find the code used for the application</li>
<li>Slide deck presentation which describe the algorithm used to build the model</li>
<li>The final application which is a word predictor application</li>
</ol>

<h3>Word Prediction APP</h3>
<p>The prediction model uses a tidy data applied to text mining in R. To building the model algorithm we considered the next steps:</p>  
<ol>
<li>The training data comes from three types sources <b>Twitter</b>, <b>Blogs</b> and <b>News</b> files</li> 
<li>Cleaning and removing the non-alphanumeric's, url's and repeated letters</li> 
<li>Data separation in N grams (the model consider 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 ngrams dataframes)</li>
<li>Finally, selecting the most probably word to predict the next word of a phrase.</li> 
</ol>

<p>The user will have to write a word or a phrase in the input panel and then press the submit button to receive the next word.<p/>
<p><b>Additional note</b>: due to the large dataset, we use a 5% of the original data to train the model so there is a possibility that the user will need to enter another phrase if the application does not find a word.</p>
