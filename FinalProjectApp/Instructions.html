<h2>Final Project Submission</h2>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.</li> 
<li>A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with <a href = "https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations">R Studio Presenter</a> pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor</li> 
</ol>

<h3>Review criteria</h3>
<h4>Data Product</h4>

<ul>
<li>Does the link lead to a Shiny app with a text input box that is running on shinyapps.io?</li>
<li>Does the app load to the point where it can accept input?</li>
<li>When you type a phrase in the input box do you get a prediction of a single word after pressing submit and/or a suitable delay for the model to compute the answer?</li>
<li>Put five phrases drawn from Twitter or news articles in English leaving out the last word. Did it give a prediction for every one?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Slide Deck</h4>
<ul>
<li>Does the link lead to a 5 slide deck on R Pubs?</li> 
<li>Does the slide deck contain a description of the algorithm used to make the prediction?</li> 
<li>Does the slide deck describe the app, give instructions, and describe how it functions?</li>
<li>How would you describe the experience of using this app?</li>
<li>Does the app present a novel approach and/or is particularly well done?</li>
<li>Would you hire this person for your own data science startup company?</li>
</ul>
